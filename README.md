To whom it may concern,
Welcome, and thanks for downloading stockpractice2.0. This software is not meant for actual stock 
trading, nor is it equiped to. Instead, it allows you to practice on old stock records. The program
uses GE, Apple, AMD, Nokia, and MicroSoft, but you can replace these records easily. You can download 
this software for no cost and modify it as much as you want, even for comercial use. Just give me 
a citation.

================
How to download:
There are 2 ways to download this program. The first is to copy and paste the python code from my 
github page onto your python IDE, and have the needed modules. If you can do this, great; if you 
can't, there's option 2: download a .exe file I made. 

I have a link to a google cloud account in these files. Just copy and paste the URL. You'll see 
zip file, and a bunch of files which are the contents of the zip file. Download 1 of them. You'll 
get a message that says that Windows thinks that the files are a virus. It's not, but Windows isn't 
sure so it just errs on the side of caution. If you are concerned, option 1 is still available. It's 
the same application. But if you just want it, there is no virus, I wouldn't attach my name to a virus.
If you chose to download it, make sure you have a folder with .exe file and the .csv files together. 
The zip file is the easiest, you just need to extract it. Click on the .exe file or the short cut. 
Windows is again going to stop you saying it thinks this .exe might be a virus. Again, Windows doesn't 
know what this is so it just assumes it a virus. If you'd like to run anyways, there's a line of blue 
text in the message ' More details.' Click on it and it Windows will give you the option of running anyways. 
My program will then boot up, but give it a minute. It's slow to boot up. 

================
How to use:
When running, You should see 2 windows pop up, one for stocks and another inputs.The graph window is 
just for display. The other window is what your going to be doing most of your work on. To opperate, 
put a numerical value in the entry boxes to the left. These signify the amount of that stock you'd 
like to buy; make sure you fill all these out or you'll confuse the program. This can be negative too. 
If you but too much a window will open up telling you so. You can find the total sum of what you'll 
buy by pressing on an estimation button in the top left corner. 

This program is writen from the perspective of a stock trader that has a starting budget of $1000, and
is looking at 5 stocks once a week. The stocks are not fictional; there actual closing price records 
from yahoo finance of GE, Apple, AMD, Nokia, and MicroSoft. These are contained in .csv files that
are avaiable with this download. In order for the program to work, these files and the 
stockpractice2.0.exe have to be in the same folder. If you'd like to make a shortcut, this folder
has one ready made.

====================

Concerns:

Stockpractice2.0 is a very light program, and is made from very common software with no hardware requirements 
that I could find: tkinter, Pandas, and Matplotlib. However, this was made by an amateur programmer, 
and tested on one computer. I can't predict how this will respond to every machine, and will not take responcibility for
what happens. This program is free, but comes with no garuntees, warenty, or other attachments. If it doesn't work, that's
ok. If it turns your computer into slag, I'll be very curious what happened, and in no way responcible. I really doubt that 
will heppen, 10^-100,000,000,000 chance, but just in case it does, you use at your own risk.
