To whom it may concern,
Welcome, and thanks for downloading stockpractice2.0. This software is not meant for actual stock 
trading, nor is it equiped to. Instead, it allows you to practice on old stock records. The program
uses GE, Apple, AMD, Nokia, and MicroSoft, but you can replace these records easily. You can download 
this software for no cost and modify it as much as you want, even for comercial use. Just give me a 
a citation.

================
How to use:
To use the application stockpractice2.0, click on either the short cut stockpractice2.0, 
or the stockpractice2.0.exe file. Wait a minute, it's slow to start. You should see 2 windows
pop up, one for stocks and another inputs. The graph window is just for display. The other window
is what your going to be doing most of your work on. To opperate, put a numerical value in the entry 
boxes to the left. These signify the amount of that stock you'd like to buy; make sure you fill all 
these out or you'll confuse the program. This can be negative too. If you but too much a window will 
open up telling you so. You can find the total sum of what you'll buy by pressing on an estimation 
button in the top left corner. 

This program is writen from the perspective of a stock trader that has a starting budget of $1000, and
is looking at 5 stocks once a week. The stocks are not fictional; there actual closing price records 
from yahoo finance of GE, Apple, AMD, Nokia, and MicroSoft. These are contained in .csv files that
are avaiable with this download. In order for the program to work, these files and the 
stockpractice2.0.exe have to be in the same folder. If you'd like to make a shortcut, this folder
has one ready made.

====================
Concerns:

Stockpractice2.0 is a very light program, and is made from very common software with no hardware requirements 
that I could find: tkinter, Pandas, and Matplotlib. However, this was made by an amateur programmer, 
and tested on one computer. I can't predict how this will respond to every machine, and will not take responcibility for
what happens. This program is free, but comes with no garuntees, warenty, or other attachments. If it doesn't work, that's
ok. If it turns your computer into slag, I'll be very curious what happened, and in no way responcible. I really doubt that 
will heppen, 10^-100,000,000,000 chance, but just in case it does, you use at your own risk.
